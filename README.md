# LK-99 Superconductor Simulation and Analysis

This project provides tools for the synthesis, analysis, and simulation of the LK-99 superconductor, a modified-lead apatite crystal structure with room-temperature superconducting properties.
 
## Introduction

LK-99 is a new material that exhibits superconducting properties at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. This project aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for synthesizing, analyzing, and simulating the material's behavior.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ntfargo/lk99.git
pip install .
```

# What's Next
- Refining the simulation process to incorporate more details from the synthesis process, such as heating conditions, material transformation, material mixing, vacuum conditions, and sulfur evaporation.

- Implementing analysis methods to study the crystal structure, resistivity, I-V characteristics, and Meissner effect of the synthesized material.

- Developing a simulation for the superconducting properties of the material and creating a phase diagram.

This project is hobby at my free time and require additional data to proceed further with the implementation!
